`start.sh` will also setup the environment of the challenge. It's recommended way to setup.

* `./start.sh` will cleanup and run the service at local. (bind on `localhost:12345`)
* `./start.sh cleanup` will only cleanup the service files

We will use the other config on prod service, but will not affect the challenge.
